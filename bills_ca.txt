( commencing with section # ) of division # of the health and safety code ) has been one of the most effective tools for helping a city and region recover from the devastating economic effects of underutilization of a major regional manufacturing center , such as the nummi plant . however , the adoption of a redevelopment plan is a time and cost intensive process , with many uncertainties . a streamlined process for adoption of a redevelopment plan for a project area encompassing or surrounding the nummi plant will allow for more efficient use of the community redevelopment law while reducing the uncertainties associated with the redevelopment plan adoption process . the extension of the bay area rapid transit ( bart ) system and the construction of the warm springs bart station represents a unique opportunity to incorporate transit - oriented development in the vicinity of the nummi plant . therefore , allowing the area encompassing or surrounding the warm springs bart station to be included in the project area encompassing or surrounding the nummi plant will allow for better coordination of development of these areas . sec . # . with the enactment of this act , it is the intent of the legislature to do both of the following : provide a means of mitigating the economic and social degradation faced by the community of fremont and its surrounding region resulting from the reduced operation , or possible closure , of the nummi plant site in fremont , california . enable the fremont redevelopment agency to adopt a redevelopment plan for a project area encompassing or surrounding the nummi plant site and encompassing and surrounding the warm springs bart station in order to alleviate underutilization resulting from adverse economic conditions and to foster economic reuse opportunities . it is not the intent of the legislature to authorize the fremont redevelopment agency to include large areas of undeveloped land within this project area . sec . # . the fremont redevelopment agency may adopt a redevelopment plan , pursuant to this act , for a project area including all , or any portion of , the area encompassing or surrounding the nummi plant and all , or any portion of , the area encompassing or surrounding the warm springs bart station . the project area may also include territory outside the area encompassing or surrounding the nummi plant or the warm springs bart station if that territory is characterized by blight , as that term is defined in sections # and # of the health and safety code or section # of this act . all territory outside the plant or station included within the project area shall be characterized as predominately urbanized , as that term is defined in subdivision of section # . # , if either of the following occur : the legislative body of the fremont redevelopment agency determines the territory is underutilized relative to densities of development typically found in proximity to other stations making up the bart system . at the time of adoption of the redevelopment plan , the legislative body has initiated proceedings to adopt a specific plan or a general plan amendment to increase the utilization of that territory . the fremont redevelopment agency may adopt a project area either pursuant to this act and the community redevelopment law , or solely pursuant to the community redevelopment law . a redevelopment plan or project area adopted by the fremont redevelopment agency pursuant to this act shall be subject to all other applicable laws , including , but not limited to , the community redevelopment law and the california environmental quality act ( division # ( commencing with section # ) of the public resources code ) , except as provided by this act . sec . # . for purposes of adopting a redevelopment plan for a project area pursuant to this act , this section describes the conditions that cause blight . in order for an area to qualify as being blighted under this section , the area shall meet at least two of the following conditions : the existence of a building or buildings in which it is unsafe or unhealthy for an individual to live or work due to unsafe or unhealthy conditions , including , but not limited to , serious building code violations , dilapidation and deterioration , defective design or physical construction , faulty or inadequate infrastructure , presence of hazardous materials , or other similar factors . the existence of buildings or areas with factors inhibiting their economically viable reuse , including , but not limited to , substandard design , being too large or too small , given present standards and market conditions , age , obsolescence , deterioration , dilapidation , or other physical conditions that could prevent the highest and best uses of the property . the existence of economic conditions that prevent economic development , including , but not limited to , abnormally high business vacancies , substantial job losses , abnormally low lease rates , or an abnormally high number of abandoned buildings or leaseable square feet . the existence of buildings that do not comply with subdivision , zoning , or planning regulations . the existence of infrastructure that does not meet existing adopted utility or community infrastructure standards . the existence of buildings that do no currently conform to the effective building , plumbing , mechanical , or electrical codes adopted by the community where the project area is located , or that do not meet the current codes for planned reuse without rehabilitation or retrofit . the existence of specialized materials , facilities , or equipment that must be removed or substantially modified to allow for development . sec . # . in adopting a redevelopment plan pursuant to this act , the procedural requirements of chapter # ( commencing with section # ) of part # of division # of the health and safety code shall be modified as follows : the preliminary plan and redevelopment plan shall not be required to demonstrate conformance with the community 's general plan . however , the fremont redevelopment agency shall not receive or expend tax increment funds from the project area until its legislative body determines that the redevelopment plan is consistent with the community 's general plan . the report on the redevelopment plan shall not be required to include the report of the planning commission . the report of the county fiscal officer and the preliminary report shall not be required to be more complete than the information currently available permits . sec . # . consistent with section # of article xvi of the california constitution , the assessed value of the taxable properties in a project area created pursuant to this act shall be reviewed by the county assessor prior to the effective date of the ordinance adopted by the fremont redevelopment agency for purposes of establishing the assessment roll to be used in connection with the taxation of the subject properties . this review shall consider , among other things , the occurrence of any of the following events : removal of personal property and equipment from the nummi plant . a successful assessment appeal filed by the owner of the nummi plant . a transfer of ownership that triggers a reassessment of the transferred property . sec . # . for the purposes of this act , the term "redevelopment" as defined in article # ( commencing with section # ) of chapter # of part # of division # of the health and safety code , shall include the provision of funding for the development of school facilities that will serve future residents of a project area . in order to fund the development of school facilities that will serve those residents , the fremont redevelopment agency may use tax increment revenue from the project area to assist in funding school facilities that will serve those residents . this use of tax increment revenue shall not affect , and will be in addition to , any transfer of tax increment to a taxing entity or school district required by the community redevelopment law ( part # ( commencing with section # ) of division # of the health and safety code ) . notwithstanding any contrary law , the city of fremont , upon the request of the fremont redevelopment agency , may impose a higher maximum school facilities development impact fee than that provided for in chapter # . # ( commencing with section # ) of division # of title # of the government code with respect to residential developments in the project area . sec . # . the legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of section # of article iv of the california constitution because of unique economic circumstances in the area served by the fremont redevelopment agency relating to the underutilization of the nummi automobile manufacturing plant and the construction of the warm springs bart station . sec . # . if the commission on state mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state , reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to part #

existing law provides that # hours of labor constitute a day 's work unless it is otherwise expressly stipulated by the parties to a contract . existing law also authorizes the industrial welfare commission to establish maximum hours of work for employees . this bill would provide that hours worked in excess of # hours in one day shall be compensated at the rate of one and one - half times the employee 's regular rate of pay , and hours worked in excess of # hours in one day shall be compensated at the rate of twice the employee 's regular rate of pay , unless it is otherwise expressly stipulated by the parties to a valid collective bargaining agreement . the bill would specify that it does not prohibit the commission from establishing a system for voluntary alternative work schedules within a #hour workweek , provided that no employee is permitted to work more than # hours in any day without the payment of premium pay , as prescribed . the bill would exempt , from the overtime provisions of the wage orders of the commission , the first # hours of work performed in a workweek by an employee , as specified , to make up work time lost in the same workweek as a result of personal obligations . the bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute . vote : #/# . appropriation : no . fiscal committee : no . state - mandated local program : no . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . this act shall be known and may be cited as the "eight hour day preservation and workplace flexibility act of # . " sec . # . the legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following : the eight - hour workday is the mainstay of protection for california 's working people , and has been for over # years . in # california enacted the first daily overtime law setting the eight - hour daily standard , long before the federal government enacted overtime protections for workers . without the eight - hour limitation , many employers would lengthen the workday to twelve or more hours , resulting in extreme fatigue and stress to workers . ending daily overtime would result in a substantial pay cut for california workers who currently receive daily overtime . numerous studies have linked long work hours to increased rates of accident and injury . family life suffers when either or both parents are kept away from home for an extended period of time on a daily basis . the industrial welfare commission has opened wage boards designed to alter wage orders by deleting the requirement to pay premium wages after eight hours of work a day . therefore , the legislature affirms the importance of the eight - hour workday , declares that it should be protected , and reaffirms the state 's unwavering commitment to upholding the eight - hour workday as a fundamental protection for working people . sec . # . section # of the labor code is amended to read : # . eight hours of labor constitutes a day 's work , unless it is otherwise expressly stipulated by the parties to a contract valid collective bargaining agreement . except as provided in section # and subdivision of this section , hours worked in excess of eight hours in one day shall be compensated at the rate of one and one - half times the employee 's regular rate of pay , and hours worked in excess of # hours in one day shall be compensated at the rate of twice the employee 's regular rate of pay , unless it is otherwise expressly stipulated by the parties to a valid collective bargaining agreement . time spent commuting to and from the first place at which an employee 's presence is required by the employer shall not be considered to be a part of a day 's work , when the employee commutes in a vehicle owned , leased , or subsidized by the employer used for the purpose of ridesharing , as defined in section # of the vehicle code . nothing in this section shall be construed to affect , change , or limit an employer 's liability under the workers' compensation law . nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the industrial welfare commission from establishing a system for voluntary alternative schedules within a #hour workweek , provided that no employee shall be permitted to work more than # hours in any day without the payment of premium pay at the rates prescribed by subdivision . sec . # . section # is added to the labor code , to read : # . if an employer approves the written request of an employee to make up work time that is lost as a result of a personal obligation of the employee , the first two hours of that makeup work , if performed in the same workweek in which the work time was lost , shall not be deemed to constitute overtime for purposes of the overtime provisions of the wage orders of the industrial welfare commission . this section shall not be construed to limit or otherwise modify the application of the overtime provisions of the wage orders of the industrial welfare commission except as expressly provided in subdivision . sec . # . this act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace , health , or safety within the meaning of article iv of the constitution and shall go into immediate effect . the facts constituting the necessity are : the requirement of overtime pay for work in excess of eight hours is threatened by administrative action . in addition , the requirement for premium overtime compensation for limited hours used to make up lost work time due to employees' personal obligations has proven to be a burden both to employees and employers , without enhancing employee protection for the eight - hour workday . in order to provide specified overtime compensation for employees who work over eight hours a day and to relieve affected employees and businesses of unnecessary requirements without delay , while preserving existing protections for the eight - hour workday , it is necessary that this act take effect immediately .

cal program . by # , this conversion resulted in savings to the general fund of almost one billion dollars ( $# , # , # , # ) . the original intent was to use this savings to enhance the program , including improving the wages and benefits of ihss program personnel pursuant to section # . # of the welfare and institutions code . most ihss personnel are paid at the minimum wage , with no additional benefits . due to the recession and resulting decreases in revenues , this savings was used to prevent program reductions . in addition , counties lost revenue from the recession and from the property tax transfer . the state 's economy has now improved , and there is additional revenue available . there are also additional savings available through the ihss program by transferring the aged , blind , and disabled medically needy recipients to the personal care option program . therefore , in order to improve the quality of ihss personnel and their working conditions , and in order to reduce turnover in ihss personnel , it is the intent of the legislature to reinvest a portion of these savings in the program , specifically for wage and benefit increases , and to provide county relief by providing funds for the county share of cost . sec . # . section # . # of the welfare and institutions code is amended to read : # . # . notwithstanding sections # and # . # , a county board of supervisors may , at its option , elect to do either of the following : contract with a nonprofit consortium to provide for the delivery of in -

existing law requires the department of motor vehicles , upon proper application , to issue driver 's licenses and identification cards . the federal western hemisphere travel initiative facilitates travel within the western hemisphere by authorizing the use of enhanced driver 's licenses and identification cards meeting specified requirements as travel documents . this bill would authorize the department of motor vehicles to enter into a memorandum of understanding with a federal agency for the purpose of facilitating travels within the western hemisphere pursuant to the federal western hemisphere travel initiative through the issuance of an enhanced driver 's license , instruction permit , provisional license , or identification card . the bill would authorize the department to issue or renew , upon request , an enhanced driver 's license , instruction permit , provisional license , or identification card for specified persons . the bill would require a person applying for the initial issuance or renewal of an enhanced driver 's license , instruction permit , provisional license , or identification card to submit , under the penalty of perjury , additional proof of identity , residency , and citizenship that satisfies the requirements of the federal western hemisphere travel initiative . because the knowledge of the submission of fraudulent information is a crime , the bill would create a new crime , thereby imposing a state - mandated local program . the bill would , except as specified , prohibit the disclosure of information submitted to the department . because a violation of the vehicle code is a crime , this bill would impose a state - mandated local program . the bill would prohibit an employer from requiring an employee to apply for , or use , an enhanced driver 's license or identification card as a condition of employment or to discriminate or otherwise retaliate against an employee who refuses to apply for , or use , an enhanced driver 's license or identification card . because a violation of this provision would be a crime , this bill would impose a state - mandated local program . the bill would also require the department to submit an annual report to specified committees of the legislature on the implementation of the enhanced driver 's license and identification card . the bill would require a person applying for an enhanced driver' s license , instruction permit , provisional license , or identification card to submit an additional application fee of $# . the bill would establish the enhanced driver 's license and identification card subaccount in the motor vehicle account and would require the additional fee to be deposited into the subaccount . the bill would , upon appropriation by the legislature , require the moneys in the subaccount to be expended by the department in implementing the above provisions . the california constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state . statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement . this bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason . vote : majority . appropriation : no . fiscal committee : yes . state - mandated local program : yes . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . the legislature finds and declares all of the following : every year , there are over # million personal vehicle passengers and # million pedestrians crossing into the state from mexico . border crossers have an economic impact on the state , accounting annually for four billion five hundred thousand dollars ( $# , # , # , # ) in economic benefits and # , # jobs . border wait times during peak hours average # minutes on weekdays and even longer on weekends . more than # million trips are lost due to congestion each year in the san ysidro port of entry , the busiest port of entry in the world . in the san diego region alone , this translates into a revenue loss of nearly one billion three hundred thousand dollars ( $# , # , # , # ) , # million potential working hours , # , # jobs , and forty - two million dollars ( $# , # , # ) in wages . it is estimated that border wait times will significantly increase in the future and an additional # minutes in border wait times will affect productivity in the binational border region by an additional one billion dollars ( $# , # , # , # ) in costs and a loss of # , # jobs . since border wait times impede international travel , trade , and commerce , the legislature must address this problem to protect california 's jobs and economy . after the #/# attacks , the federal government enacted the federal western hemisphere travel initiative ( whti ; public law # ) , to facilitate entry for united states citizens and legitimate foreign visitors , while strengthening united states border security , by requiring united states and canadian travelers to present a passport or other documents that denote identity and citizenship when entering the united states . the documentation requirements of the whti went into effect in # for air travel into the united states and in # for land and sea travel . in addition to a passport and other documents , the federal government approved , for cross - border travel , the use of an enhanced driver 's license ( edl ) , which is a standard state - issued driver 's license that has been enhanced in process , technology , and security to denote identity and citizenship for purposes of entering the united states at the land and sea ports of entry . an edl contains radio frequency identification ( rfid ) technology , which allows information contained in a wireless device or tag to be read from a distance , and eliminates the need to key in travelers , translating into # percent faster processing than manual queries . another advantage of an edl is that it can be used in "ready lanes , " which were created by the united states customs and border protection and are used as primary vehicle lanes dedicated to travelers who possess rfid -

system . existing law establishes the public school system in this state , and , among other things , provides for the establishment of school districts throughout the state and for their provision of instruction at the public elementary and secondary schools they operate and maintain . existing law establishes a public school funding system that includes , among other elements , the provision of funding to local educational agencies through state apportionments , the proceeds of property taxes collected at the local level , and other sources . this bill would require the superintendent of public instruction , on or before december # , # , to make recommendations to the legislature and the governor regarding prescribed topics relating to the statutory and regulatory changes that would be necessary to support the development , implementation , and use of comprehensive school - level financial data . these provisions would be repealed on december # , # . the bill would require the superintendent , on or before july # , # , to make all ministerial changes that are necessary to support the future reporting of school - level financial data by local educational agencies , as specified . the bill also would require the superintendent , on or before july # , # , and annually thereafter , to notify the superintendent of each school district and county office of education , and the administrator of each charter school , of specified items relating to tracking and reporting school - level financial data . vote : majority . appropriation : no . fiscal committee : yes . state - mandated local program : no . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . the legislature finds and declares all of the following : the # studies of the getting down to facts project and the governor 's committee on education excellence were consistent in their conclusions that california 's current education finance system is overly complex , irrational , and burdensome , and is in need of a long - term plan for comprehensive reform . the complexity of the current system poses a major obstacle to transparency and effectiveness . it is almost impossible to determine how much revenue each school district receives or how those revenues are spent , let alone to report this information to local communities , stakeholders , and the state . the current system is not logical , with district revenues that are largely a historical artifact of spending in the #s combined with a confusing , bureaucratic , report - driven , and burdensome system of categorical programs . disparities in school and district revenues are substantial and are not aligned to pupil or educator needs . the system places substantial restrictions on the use of resources by schools and districts , creating high compliance costs and making it difficult for local educators to respond to the needs of their pupils . fewer paperwork requirements and more flexibility in allocating resources are cited by school principals as two of the most important factors in improving pupil outcomes . many schools and districts lack the proper tools or capacity to ensure that money is spent on the most effective programs and practices . research consistently finds that successful schools use data to inform teaching practices and innovation . however , california schools and districts vary widely in their use of data and in their capacity to use data to improve pupil performance . ensuring that money is spent efficiently and effectively requires a complete understanding of how money is allocated by school districts and spent within schools . however , california does not collect financial data that is useful for determining the effectiveness of resources at the state , district , or school levels . california is currently facing lawsuits which claim that the state 's system for funding public education is deficient . one lawsuit claims that the system is unconstitutional in that it fails to provide all pupils with equal access to the required educational program , while a second lawsuit seeks to have the state take the individual educational needs of each pupil into consideration when it makes funding decisions pursuant to the system . therefore , it is the intent of the legislature to do all of the following : build on previous research and recommendations to produce a comprehensive plan for finance reform to support pupil achievement , with specific consideration given to the interactions of incentives in school finance formulas . establish simpler pupil - based formulas for allocating funding to each local educational agency that provide base funding along with an amount that is tied to the specific needs of the pupils in the local educational agency and the costs of educating those pupils . make the allocation of funding more rational and equitable so that the revenues received by each local educational agency reflect the actual cost of educating pupils with varying needs in varying environments , so that all pupils are prepared , at the end of their elementary and secondary education , for college , careers , and successful participation in our democratic institutions , no matter where they live or what their economic , racial , or ethnic background may be . support accountability and local flexibility by increasing the transparency of state funding mechanisms and of expenditure decisions at the local level , and by facilitating the equitable allocation of funds across schools within each school district in a manner that reflects the specific needs of the pupils in those schools and the costs of educating those pupils . improve the reporting of financial data so that programmatic investments can be linked to programs that increase pupil achievement . support continuous improvement by requiring periodic review of the school finance system and of local resource decisions . hold local educational agencies harmless , and transition to the new system gradually , as new moneys become available . sec . # . section # is added to the education code , to read : # . on or before december # , # , the superintendent shall make recommendations to the legislature and the governor concerning statutory and regulatory changes that would be necessary to support the development , implementation , and use of comprehensive school - level financial data that would be used to produce all of the following : simple to use , transparent , and informative school - level financial reports showing both the source of school - level revenue and the expenditures made by each school . in - depth analyses of school - level financial data including , but not necessarily limited to , analyses by fund source , function , program , and object . comparisons of financial data across schools , both within the district and outside of the district , and over time . linkages between school -

level data analysis and evaluative tools , as well as publicly available school - level reports . it is the intent of the legislature that the superintendent , in making the recommendations pursuant to this section , shall do both of the following : build upon previous research , reports , evaluations , audits , and studies . develop the recommendations in consultation with policymakers , members of the education community , members of the public , and other stakeholders . a report to be submitted pursuant to subdivision shall be submitted in compliance with section # of the government code . pursuant to section # . # of the government code , this section is repealed on december # , # . sec . # . section # is added to the education code , to read : # . on or before july # , # , the superintendent shall make all ministerial changes that are necessary to support the future reporting of school - level financial data reporting by local educational agencies . these changes shall include , but are not limited to , all of the following : modifications to the standardized account code structure . modifications to the california school accounting manual . modifications to financial regulations imposed upon or other instructions provided to school districts , county offices of education , or charter schools . on or before july # , # , and annually thereafter , the superintendent shall notify the superintendent of each school district and county office of education , and the administrator of each charter school , of both of the following : the capacity for the tracking and reporting of school -

existing law establishes the franchise tax board and prescribes its various powers and duties regarding , among other things , the administration of state personal income taxes and requires that an income tax return be filed by every individual who has income in excess of specified amounts . existing law allows an income tax return to be filed with the franchise tax board using an individual taxpayer identification number . this bill would make findings and declarations regarding immigration and immigrants within the united states and california , including encouraging those immigrants who are not eligible to receive a social security number to file a california state income tax return using an individual taxpayer identification number and that california would benefit by providing undocumented persons who are agricultural or service industry employees with a permit to work and live in the state . vote : majority . appropriation : no . fiscal committee : no . state - mandated local program : no . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . the legislature finds and declares all of the following : the united states of america is a nation of values , founded on the principles that all men and women are created equal , and the promise of freedom for all . we are a nation of immigrants , who believe in the promise of freedom and opportunity . the current immigration system is broken , antiquated , and not meeting the challenges of the #st century . it separates families , including same - sex couple families , creates long backlogs for families seeking reunification , and neglects the hard work and financial contributions immigrants make to our country . since # , more than # . # million immigrants have been deported , and one in every # american children faces the threat of the deportation of a parent . approximately # million undocumented immigrants are in the united states , and california has the largest population of immigrants , both legal and undocumented . immigrants and their children constitute nearly one - half of california 's population and live and work in all # counties , most notably in the san diego , central valley , los angeles , ventura , and greater san francisco areas . approximately # percent of undocumented immigrants who reside in california live with family members who are legal united states residents and citizens . one in # workers in california is an undocumented immigrant , and immigrants are a vibrant , productive , and vital part of the state' s growing economy . immigrants are essential in keeping the american economy strong ; from technology programmers in the silicon valley to restaurant owners and workers , immigrants are filling an intrinsic need in the labor force . agricultural workers have been performing very important and difficult work to maintain america 's food supply , and have a role of ensuring that americans have safe and secure agricultural products to sell and consume . students should not be punished for their immigration status . instead , they should be given recognition for their sacrifice , hard work , and determination . the united states can do a better job of attracting and keeping the world 's best and brightest . a comprehensive immigration reform should also grant immigrants who have received a ph . d . or master 's degree in science , technology , engineering , or mathematics from an american university the opportunity to invest in and contribute to this great nation . for the future of our economy , it makes no sense to educate the world 's future innovators and entrepreneurs only to ultimately force them to leave our country at the moment they are most able to contribute to our economy . modernizing our antiquated and dysfunctional immigration system will uphold our nation 's basic values of fairness and equality , as well as access to health care . a comprehensive , as well as compassionate , approach to solve our broken immigration system should be one that works for all communities and families in america . the full recovery of the california economy depends upon the continued residence and employment of all current and future members of the state workforce , whether currently employed or in the process of education or training for future employment . the removal of residents and employees , who are free of any serious criminal history or criminal misconduct , from the state during this time of economic recovery is disruptive of the nascent recovery , and separates and disrupts families and community , with significant secondary effects on the state economy and the state education system . the legislature recognizes and acknowledges the federal government 's exclusive authority in the area of immigration regulation , including the determination of enforcement priorities and the granting of discretionary relief on an individual or class wide basis . the failure of the congress to act on much - needed federal legislation to provide relief from deportation and a pathway to citizenship for those millions of undocumented persons who have resided peacefully in california and other states for many years , raising families , paying taxes , and contributing to our economy and society , has perpetuated a structural problem in our state economy , with too many workers intimidated from playing a complete role in our social and economic development by the lack of legal protection occasioned by their status . despite these impediments , many undocumented workers have endeavored year after year to file california state income tax returns using an individual taxpayer identification number . encouraging those who are not eligible to receive a social security number to file a california state income tax return using an individual taxpayer identification number is in the best interest of the state , its economy , and its tax laws . california will benefit from a program to provide undocumented persons who are agricultural or service industry employees with a permit to work and live in california .

" # . the legislature finds and declares the following : the state economy , which is the seventh largest in the world , is fueled by increasing involvement in the international marketplace . the global competitiveness of the state economy increasingly requires workers to be able to communicate in a multilingual environment . to the extent feasible , the state should provide pupils in elementary and secondary public schools with full access to foreign language instruction in order to increase the capability of those pupils to participate in the future of the state .

record information . existing law provides for the licensure and regulation , by the state department of social services , of child day care facilities . existing law makes a violation of these provisions a crime . existing law requires the department or any other approving authority to perform a criminal record check on an applicant for a license to operate a child day care facility , as well as for staff and employees of a child day care facility . existing law prohibits the dissemination of criminal record information by a local law enforcement agency except as prescribed . this bill would , notwithstanding any other provision of law , permit a law enforcement agency to release to a child day care facility or to a family day care home not subject to child day care facility licensing provisions , criminal record information and other information concerning any encounter that specified persons have had with law enforcement that is not already available under existing law if that person has voluntarily signed a waiver . this bill would require the department to prepare a waiver form that describes the person 's statutory and constitutional privacy rights under existing law and to provide these forms to law enforcement agencies . this bill would require that the waiver shall only extend to access to the information by a person who works at , operates , or is otherwise affiliated with the facility . this bill would provide that any person who works at , operates , or is otherwise affiliated with the facility who obtains and disseminates information , not otherwise public , which that person knows or should reasonably know was obtained from confidential information , to a #rd party is subject to a civil action for invasion of privacy by the individual to whom the information pertains . because a violation of child day care facility provisions is a crime , this bill would , by creating a new crime , constitute a state - mandated local program . the california constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state . statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement . this bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason . vote : majority . appropriation : no . fiscal committee : yes . state - mandated local program : yes . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . section # . # is added to the health and safety code , to read : # . # . notwithstanding article # . # ( commencing with section # ) of chapter # of title # of part # of the penal code or any other provision of law , a law enforcement agency may disseminate criminal offender record information or any other information concerning any encounter with law enforcement that is not already available under existing law of any person described under subdivision of section # . # to a day care facility or a family day care home described in subdivision of section # . # , if that person voluntary signs a waiver as described in subdivision . the department shall prepare the waiver forms described in subdivision and distribute them to law enforcement agencies . the forms shall include a statement advising the person of the confidential nature of the information and of any existing statutory or constitutional right to privacy he or she has in the information under existing law . the waiver shall only apply to the dissemination of the information by a law enforcement agency to a child day care facility or a family day care home . a person who works at , operates , or is otherwise affiliated with a child day care facility or a family day care home who receives information pursuant to this section may not disclose this information to any third party unless otherwise authorized to do so according to existing law . any person who works at , operates , or is otherwise affiliated with a child day care facility or a family day care home and who intentionally discloses information , not otherwise public , which that person knows or should have known was obtained from confidential information obtained pursuant to this section , shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to those criminal penalties specified in section # . # . sec . # . no reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to section # of article xiii b of the california constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction , eliminates a crime or infraction , or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction , within the meaning of section # of the government code , or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of section # of article xiii b of the california constitution . 
existing federal law provides for allocation of federal funds through the federal temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) block grant program to eligible states . existing law provides for the california work opportunity and responsibility to kids ( calworks ) program for the allocation of federal funds received through the tanf program , under which each county provides cash assistance and other benefits to qualified low - income families . under existing law , for purposes of determining a family 's maximum aid payment under the calworks program , the number of needy persons in the same family is not increased for any child born into a family that has received aid under the calworks program continuously for the # months prior to the birth of the child , with specified exceptions . this bill would repeal the exclusion of a child born into a family receiving aid for the # months prior to the child 's birth , for purposes of determining the family 's maximum aid payment . existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the general fund to defray a portion of county aid grant costs under the calworks program . this bill would declare that no appropriation would be made for purposes of the bill . to the extent that this bill affect eligibility under the calworks program , the bill would create a state - mandated program . the california constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state . statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement . this bill would provide that , if the commission on state mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state , reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions . vote : majority . appropriation : no . fiscal committee : yes . state - mandated local program : yes . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . this bill shall be known and may be cited as the provide for each child act . sec . # . the legislature finds and declares all of the following : under the aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) program , states were largely determining eligibility criteria based on family poverty levels and establishing benefit levels based on family size and income . most states , including california , provided a modest increase in a family 's monthly cash grant if another child was born into a family that was receiving welfare . in the #s , the federal and state government enacted policies focused on moving recipients off welfare and into the workforce . legislation to expand programs for education , job training , and employment opportunities were passed to eliminate welfare dependency . some states started to introduce child exclusions , referred to as "family caps , " which had the effect of denying additional benefits for children born into a family already receiving welfare . a family cap first appeared in california as proposition # in a # welfare ballot measure , which was rejected by voters of the state . nevertheless , in # , the legislature approved a child exclusion bill , which took effect september # , # . the provision was known as the maximum family grant ( mfg ) rule , and operated by ignoring a child from the calculation of income if that child was born while the family was receiving cash assistance . in # , congress passed the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act , replacing afdc with temporary assistance for needy families ( tanf ) . among others , the goals of tanf were to provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives , and end the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation , work , and marriage . tanf imposed a #month time limit on the length of time families could be on cash assistance . tanf neither mandates nor prohibits child exclusion , leaving states the discretion to do as they see fit . under tanf , california has no obligation to provide an evaluation process for the mfg rule . to this day , there are no known studies on the impact of the mfg rule in california . child exclusion was intended to discourage families on welfare from having additional children . however , in september # , after a review of the literature on the rule in various states , the general accounting office ( gao ) reported , "we cannot conclude that family cap policies reduce the incidence of out - of - wedlock births , affects the number of abortions , or change the size of the tanf caseload . " child exclusion provisions like the mfg rule reflect the concern that some welfare mothers would intentionally get pregnant in order to get an increase in benefits , and the perception that families on assistance are too large . in fact , from # to # , the average size of a tanf family was # . # persons . similarly , in # , the average size of a typical american household was # . # . the increase in monthly aid that a family gets in california is about one hundred thirty - nine dollars ( $# ) if child exclusion does not apply . in california , a family of two receives a maximum of five hundred eighty - four dollars ( $# ) per month in cash aid under calworks , bringing the family 's annual income to seven thousand eight dollars ( $# , # ) . a family of three receives seven hundred twenty - three dollars ( $# ) per month bringing its annual income to eight thousand five hundred seventy - six dollars ( $# , # ) . a family of four receives a maximum of eight hundred sixty - two dollars ( $# ) per month bringing its annual income to ten thousand three hundred forty - four dollars ( $# , # ) . the federal poverty guidelines are twelve thousand four hundred ninety dollars ( $# , # ) for a family of two ; fifteen thousand six hundred seventy dollars ( $# , # ) for a family of three ; and eighteen thousand eight hundred fifty dollars ( $# , # ) for a family of four . the approximate increase of one hundred thirty - nine dollars ( $# ) is barely enough to pay for a newborn 's clothing , diapers , food , and housing requirements . social science research has consistently concluded that women on welfare do not have additional children for the purpose of obtaining an increase in benefit . even without implementation of the mfg rule , the amount a family receives under calworks is already many times less than what is required to achieve a modest standard of living . a september # study by the nonprofit california budget project found that a family with two working parents and two children needs a monthly income of five thousand nine hundred forty - eight dollars ( $# , # ) in order to achieve a modest standard of living . this standard cannot be achieved by families on calworks , because they already receive so little money . implementation of the mfg rule makes the situation worse . often , when families are receiving calworks , they are working , but their jobs do not pay them enough to support their families . in may # , the center for labor research and education at the university of california , berkeley found that public assistance is becoming an ongoing wage supplement for low - wage workers rather than emergency assistance for those who find themselves unable to work and unable to meet their basic needs . most public assistance to working families goes to families with full - time workers ; # percent went to single - earner families working over # hours per week or to dual - earner families working # hours per week . moreover , # percent of public assistance benefits went to families with the equivalent of at least one full - time job ( over # hours per week ) . there is a body of research that links child poverty to poor health , developmental , and social outcomes . researchers have found that poor children are less likely to be immunized , are more likely to go hungry or report frequent instances when they did not have enough to eat , are more limited in their activities due to chronic health conditions , and are more likely to experience abuse and neglect than children in households with incomes above the poverty line . research on brain growth reveals a critical developmental period during infancy when children are more receptive to external stimuli . studies also reveal that poor children are more likely to be exposed to the risk factors that can inhibit normal brain functioning and development during this critical period . poverty is also linked to abusive family processes , parental depression , stress , and disruptions in care giving , which can significantly compromise the safety and stability of a child 's home environment . to the extent that child exclusion contributes to poor outcomes for some children , the state could bear such costs as remedial education , health and hospitalization costs , and lowered adult productivity . child exclusion was implemented , in part , to stop parents , and in particular mothers , from receiving cash assistance at a time when the #month time limit had not been established by tanf . with the passage and implementation of the #month time limit , families are becoming less dependent on calworks . repealing child exclusion would simplify county administration significantly by eliminating several administrative hurdles and costs , such as notice of this law , the requirement for client signatures indicating awareness of the policy at the annual renewal , requiring workers at social service agencies to determine if a child is an mfg child , and holding administrative hearings to determine if a child is an mfg child based on whether the agency has provided the family with adequate notice . sec . #

oil - by - rail spills : firefighters . existing law establishes the office of emergency services within the office of the governor and under the supervision of the director of emergency services and makes the office responsible for the state' s emergency and disaster response services for natural , technological , or manmade disasters and emergencies . existing law requires the office to serve as the central point of state government for the emergency reporting of spills , unauthorized releases , or other accidental releases of hazardous materials and to coordinate the notification of the appropriate state and local administering agencies that may be required to respond to those spills , unauthorized releases , or other accidental releases . existing law also establishes the curriculum development advisory committee to provide advice on the development of specified course curricula and response training . this bill would require the curriculum development advisory committee to review the curriculum and courses of instruction offered by public and private programs that train firefighters in response methods for oil - by - rail spills , require the office of emergency services to compile a list of those curriculum and courses of instruction and make that list available to all fire departments and establish a program to reimburse fire departments for costs incurred by those departments in sending firefighters to trainings , as provided . vote : majority . appropriation : no . fiscal committee : yes . state - mandated local program : no . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . the legislature finds and declares all of the following : fracking and other developing oil extraction technologies employed in canada and the united states have significantly increased oil production . this source of new oil has created a problem in the transportation and delivery of crude oil . there is currently not enough pipeline capacity in north america to transport these increased volumes to refineries and distribution points . as a result , rail is becoming the primary way to move inland crude oil and hydrocarbon gas liquids to the west coast . california like the rest of the nation is experiencing dramatic changes in the amount of oil being transported by rail . as oil - by - rail shipments have dramatically increased in recent years , there has been a resulting increase in the number of incidents involving crude oil spills by rail . the danger from a major oil spill is exacerbated by the type of oil that is being spilled . oil from the bakken shale formation is high - quality , light , sweet crude . it is precisely because this crude oil is so energy dense that it is both valuable and hazardous . its light nature and high density under the right circumstances makes it volatile , highly flammable , and toxic . crude oil trains travel through some of the state 's most densely populated areas , as well as some of the most sensitive ecological areas , since rail lines frequently operate near or over rivers and other sensitive waterways in the state . there are wide disparities in training and equipment for oil - by - rail spills in the following instances : between volunteer and nonvolunteer fire departments ; between rural and urban fire departments ; and between small and large fire departments . large , urban fire departments tend to receive more training and are better equipped than smaller rural fire departments . volunteer fire departments have almost no independent ability to respond to large scale oil - by - rail spills , relying instead upon regional mutual aid or upon railroad personnel and assets . many small and some medium - sized fire departments do not have the budget to send firefighters for training even if the costs of that training are subsidized or paid for with grants or other assistance . when a firefighter is sent for training , another off - duty firefighter must be called in to cover the shift and maintain coverage for services . this requires paying the firefighter his or her salary during his or her training and also paying an off - duty firefighter to cover the shift . railroads provide free training for local first responders in california in localities that are convenient to the fire departments , yet volunteer and small rural fire departments frequently do not attend or participate in such training classes . sec . # . section # . # is added to the government code , to read : # . # . the curriculum development advisory committee described in section # . # shall review the curriculum and courses of instruction offered by public and private programs that train firefighters in response methods for oil - by - rail spills . the office of emergency services shall compile a list of the curriculum and courses of instruction specified in subdivision , shall make that list available to all fire departments , including in that list information regarding the availability and cost of the curriculum and courses of instruction , and shall facilitate and encourage fire departments to send firefighters for that training . the office of emergency services shall establish a program to reimburse fire departments for costs incurred by those departments in sending firefighters to trainings identified by the curriculum development advisory committee and the office of emergency services pursuant to this section , upon application by the fire department for reimbursement . volunteer fire departments may also receive a per diem of one hundred dollars ( $# ) per volunteer firefighter , upon application , to be paid to a volunteer firefighter who attends such training . the office of emergency services shall use funds received from grants or general funds appropriated to the office of emergency services by the legislature for this program .

term effects , including suicide , depression , memory loss , sleep disorders , impairments in attention , and motor deficits . the effects of these injuries , while not all preventable , can be mitigated by prompt recognition and appropriate response . the competitive interscholastic athletic culture of playing through pain or "toughing it out" puts pupil athletes at serious risk . concussions have a cumulative effect . allowing an athlete to return to play too early after a concussion increases the chance of more serious brain injury . a concussion can cause rapid brain swelling that can result in coma or even death . ( # ) currently , coaches , pupil athletes , and parents of pupil athletes lack appropriate awareness about the prevention , identification , and treatment of concussions .

" according to the november # report of the employment development department , currently californians are employed largely in service industry jobs , with trade , transportation , and utilities ranking first , local government second , and professional and business services third . it is imperative that california does everything possible to maintain these jobs . however , the state also needs to create an environment that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship in order to reduce our high unemployment rate . california 's rich tradition of supporting innovation and entrepreneurial spirit led to great successes like silicon valley and our cutting edge advances in green technology , such as biofuels and hydrogen fuel cells . over the past # years these industries have created jobs for california while allowing the state to achieve huge advances in air quality standards that safeguard the health and safety of californians . despite california 's many advancements , the state has suffered a loss in manufacturing and technical service jobs to other states and regions in the world overseas . in order to remain nationally and globally competitive , california must focus on tangible solutions and alternative solutions to our unemployment rate . "economic gardening" is an innovative economic development model that embraces entrepreneurship as a driving force for job creation and growth . it originated in # in littleton , colorado , and is based on the idea that a community needs an economic development plan that utilizes its particular strengths . rather than solely relying on conventional models for attracting big businesses to communities , it encourages job growth from within , by focusing on small businesses and local entrepreneurs . in essence , economic gardening allows communities to "grow their own jobs . " this is especially useful in communities that are not able to depend on traditional business models because they lack the infrastructure or land to attract and sustain large businesses in their regions . for example , while large cities may be able to compete for global businesses and capital , smaller communities may not be able to do so and may find that concentrating on local businesses and growth is more conducive to their needs . economic gardening is based on research by david birch of the massachusetts institute of technology , who proposed that most new jobs in any local economy were produced by smaller , local , high - growth businesses . since then , a growing body of research suggests that small and local businesses are important drivers of economic growth . the united states census bureau found that between # and # , companies employing fewer than # employees accounted for # . # percent of the net new jobs in the united states . thus , encouraging the growth of small businesses may lead to greater job creation than trying to attract one or two large corporations to an area . the legislature has continually tried to make california 's youth and student populations marketable and well prepared for the changing global job market . in addition to maintaining a competitive job force , the state must foster local entrepreneurial education in our colleges and universities . as california continues to suffer from double - digit unemployment and a recurring and growing state budget deficit , it is incumbent on the state to invest in regional , innovative approaches to economic development that can create jobs and economic growth during a recession and in difficult economic times . sec . # . it is the intent of the legislature to enact legislation that would support entrepreneurship as a form of economic development and job creation in communities throughout this state . this legislation shall do all of the following : provide for regional research and assessment of urban and suburban communities regarding their particular community assets , skills , and needs , and utilize that data to determine economic opportunities in individual communities . support access to capital for entrepreneurs in these communities , including , but not limited to , microfinance . provide information on financial literacy , including information that describes how to start a business and apply for licenses , as well as education on taxation and business structure , and ongoing support . identify opportunities for local and state agencies to remove legal barriers and burdensome paperwork to make siting , zoning , and licensing easier for small businesses and startup companies in order to allow for entrepreneurial job creation . encourage cities and counties to provide opportunities for retail space development that is accessible to , and affordable for , entrepreneurial enterprises and housing that is affordable and centrally located in cities and counties . promote the development of entrepreneurial education curricula and programs in the elementary and secondary educational systems and invest in entrepreneurship training and education in the california community colleges , california state university system , and university of california system , in order to ensure that new entrants into the labor market have the skills to compete and secure jobs or create their own .

mandated local program : no . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . the legislature finds and declares all of the following : secrecy agreements that prohibit disclosure to the public or public safety agencies of information relating to defective products , financial fraud , unfair insurance claims practices , or environmental hazards are injurious to the health , safety , and economic well - being of all californians . secrecy agreements can have tragic consequences . a widely known example of the disastrous consequences of secrecy agreements is the tragedy resulting from dangerous defects in firestone tires , which have reportedly caused more than # deaths and more than # injuries worldwide . for many years , bridgestone/firestone , inc . knew about these dangerous defects , but kept the information out of the public eye by secretly settling many lawsuits brought as a result of crashes related to defective tires . during that time , the public continued to drive on firestone tires , unaware of the mortal danger to their families and themselves . as a result of these hidden , dangerous defects , on august # , # , bridgestone/firestone , inc . and ford motor co . jointly announced that firestone would recall over # million tires . in the absence of a secrecy agreement , information about this dangerous product could have been disclosed publicly , which could have saved lives and avoided injuries . however , the companies demanded secrecy as the price of compensation for victims , resulting in many deaths and injuries that could have been avoided absent demands for secrecy agreements . secrecy agreements can allow companies to shield information that shows a practice of treating consumers unfairly and can permit those companies to continue illegal practices without accountability . the circumstances that allowed secrecy regarding the claims of victims of the northridge earthquake and the contaminated drinking water connected with the story of erin brockovich also highlight the need for openness . secrecy agreements allow companies to shield life - threatening dangers and harmful practices from public view , thereby severely jeopardizing public welfare and safety . it is against the public interest to allow secrecy agreements about defective products , financial fraud , unfair insurance claims practices , or environmental hazards to remain confidential except in very limited circumstances upon careful judicial oversight and review . sec . # . section # is added to the code of civil procedure , to read : # . the legislature finds that the judicial council has adopted rule # . # of the california rules of court , which creates a presumption against secrecy for certain documents filed with the court . it is the intent of the legislature to better protect californians from injuries , deaths , or financial loss caused by defective products , financial fraud , unfair insurance claims practices , or environmental hazards by also creating a presumption against secrecy for settlement agreements and confidentiality agreements not filed with the court and information acquired through discovery . notwithstanding any other provision of law , in an action based upon injury , wrongful death , or financial loss allegedly caused by a defective product , financial fraud , unfair insurance claims practice , or environmental hazard , information concerning the defective product , financial fraud , unfair insurance claims practice , or environmental hazard contained in settlement agreements and confidentiality agreements not filed with the court , and information acquired through discovery concerning the defective product , financial fraud , unfair insurance claims practice , or environmental hazard , shall be presumed to be public information and may not be kept confidential pursuant to agreement of the parties . this information may be kept confidential for a period that the court deems appropriate only pursuant to a court order based upon a finding that either : the information is a trade secret or otherwise privileged under existing law . an overriding interest exists that overcomes the right of public access to the information . the overriding interest supports keeping the information confidential . a substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the information is not kept confidential . the proposed confidentiality is narrowly tailored . no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest . unless the information is a trade secret or otherwise privileged under existing law , in an action based upon injury , wrongful death , or financial loss allegedly caused by a defective product , financial fraud , unfair insurance claims practice , or environmental hazard , any portion of an agreement or contract that restricts a party from disclosing information relating to the defective product , financial fraud , unfair insurance claims practice , or environmental hazard to a governmental agency with enforcement authority over the defective product , financial fraud , unfair insurance claims practice , or environmental hazard is void , contrary to public policy , and may not be enforced . in order to implement this section , the court may require the requesting party to provide an identifying log or other document . as used in this section : "defective product" means a product that may be defective because of a defect in manufacturing , or design , or a failure to adequately warn the consumer of a hazard involved in the foreseeable use of the product , where the defect may result in personal injury to one or more persons . "financial fraud" means any fraudulent insurance practice or any fraudulent plan or scheme to sell a publicly offered investment product without full disclosure of the risks associated with the purchase of the product , where the plan or scheme may cause or has caused financial loss . "unfair insurance claims practice" means any act or omission that would constitute a violation of subdivision of section # . # of the insurance code . "environmental hazard" means a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance that poses a threat to public health or safety involving present or future danger of death , bodily injury , or health disability to human beings exposed to a hazardous substance release or threatened release . an attorney shall not sell or offer for sale any information obtained through discovery to any member of the state bar or to any other person in violation of the prohibitions on attorney solicitation , fee splitting , or financial arrangements among lawyers or nonlawyers included in rules # , # , and # of the rules of professional conduct adopted by the supreme court . violation of this paragraph shall be a basis for professional discipline by the state bar . this section does not alter or mitigate any existing rule or provision that may also be applicable to the conduct .

existing law provides for various programs and activities in the development of economic opportunities for businesses in the state . the california small business financial development corporation law establishes small business financial development corporations and provides for their regulation by the business , transportation and housing agency . existing law , the banking law , provides for the regulation of banks by the department of financial institutions . this bill would create a banking development district program , within the department , that would encourage the establishment of banking branches in designated geographic locations where there is an underserved community , as defined . the bill would require the department to provide information on the banking development district program to the treasurer and would authorize the treasurer to utilize the banking development district program when promoting the treasurer 's time deposit program . the bill would require the department to adopt rules and regulations for the establishment and maintenance of banking development districts and to evaluate and approve applications for designation of banking development districts . the bill would require the department to develop and provide certain incentives to banks , as defined , located in a banking development district . the bill would also require the department to establish and post on its internet web site a performance review process for the program , as specified . vote : majority . appropriation : no . fiscal committee : yes . state - mandated local program : no . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . the legislature finds and declares all of the following : too many californians are disconnected from the financial mainstream . national estimates show that # percent of households , including nearly one - quarter of the minority population , are "unbanked , " meaning they lack a basic checking or savings account . in california , # percent of adults do not have a checking or savings account , according to the united states census . recent market research indicates that fresno and los angeles have the second and third highest percentages of unbanked residents in the country . in san francisco , the brookings institution found that one in five adults , and half the city 's african americans and latinos , do not have bank accounts . the unbanked are most likely to be people who are less educated and have lower incomes . the unbanked poor pay more to conduct their financial lives . utilizing check cashing outlets and money order services to pay bills and expenses can have costly side effects as the result of fees and service charges . families without accounts often do not have a safe place to keep their money . they may walk around with large amounts of cash in their pockets , or keep it at home in a coffee can . robberies can be more prevalent around check cashing outlets . a burglary , or a fire , could cost them their life 's savings in a matter of moments . lower income households often pay more for financial services . according to a recent brookings institution study , a full - time worker without a checking account could potentially save as much as $# , # during his or her career by relying on a lower cost checking account instead of check cashing services . as a result without a checking account or lower cost checking account , lower income families have added difficulty saving for and investing in wealth - building assets , the investments they do make are too often not in their best financial interest , and business opportunities in lower income markets are unduly depressed . a bank account is also the first step to financial security and asset building for many families . a bank account helps people take the first step onto this path . without an account , it is much more difficult to get well - priced car loans , credit cards , or mortgages , which are the exact financial tools needed to climb up the economic ladder . many families stay stuck on a different and more expensive path , going to pawn shops , payday lenders , and rent - to - own stores . while financial institutions may see the long - term business potential of underserved areas , they may have a short - term concern that it would take a number of years before they can attract enough retail deposits to become viable . those concerns are magnified by the fact that lower income workers often need to use banking services in off - business hours because they work in multiple jobs , making it more difficult for banks to attract customers with standard business practices . in # , the state of new york established a banking development district program and made available a range of state and city incentives to participating financial institutions . the incentives provided through the program aim to help banks get over short - term obstacles to profitability , enabling them to branch into neighborhoods with long - term business potential , and better serve low - income consumers with existing bank branches . it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this act to create a banking development district program to spur increased and enhanced banking services in underserved communities that will spur greater financial inclusion and promote local economic development . the desired outcome is that more californians will enter the financial mainstream and build savings and wealth through participating banks' offerings and marketing of reasonably priced transactional , loan , and credit products . sec . # . division # ( commencing with section # ) is added to the financial code , to read : division # . banking development district program # . the banking development district program is hereby created in order to encourage the establishment of banking branches that provide needed products and services in specifically designated geographic locations where there is an underserved community . these designated locations shall be known as banking development districts . financial institutions may seek to participate in the program to do either of the following : open a new outlet in an area designated as a banking development district . develop and market a new product line or group of services in an existing outlet in an area that is designated as a banking development district . # . for purposes of this division , the following definitions shall apply : "bank" refers to any commercial bank , savings bank , savings association , or credit union .

term costs that prevent them from offering products and services that have long - term business potential . the incentives shall be all of the following : valuable to banks . significant enough to encourage banks to locate in an underserved community or develop new products and services within existing branches but small enough that a branch 's financial success requires services to the community . require reauthorization every two years . # . upon designation of a banking development district by the department , the bank located within the banking development district shall be eligible for a range of incentives . the range of incentives may include , but shall not be limited to , the following : access to interest -

existing law provides that marriage is a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between a man and a woman . existing law provides for the issuance of marriage licenses and imposes duties on county clerks in that connection , as specified . existing law , enacted by initiative measure , further provides that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in this state . this bill would enact the religious freedom and civil marriage protection act , which would instead provide that marriage is a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between # persons . the bill would make conforming changes with regard to the consent to , and solemnization of , marriage , and would make related findings and declarations . by adding to the duties of county employees , this bill would impose a state - mandated local program . the california constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state . statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement . this bill would provide that , if the commission on state mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state , reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions . vote : majority . appropriation : no . fiscal committee : yes . state - mandated local program : yes . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . this act shall be known and may be cited as the religious freedom and civil marriage protection act . sec . # . it is the intent of the legislature that this act be interpreted consistently with the guarantees of the first amendment to the united states constitution and of section # of article i of the california constitution to free exercise of religion and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or preference . sec . # . the legislature finds and declares as follows : civil marriage is a legal institution recognized by the state in order to promote stable relationships and to protect individuals who are in those relationships . the institution of marriage also provides important protections for the families of those who are married , including not only any children or other dependents they may have , but also members of their extended families . from # to # , california 's marriage statutes used gender - neutral language , without reference to "man" or "woman , " in providing that marriage is a personal relation arising out of a civil contract to which the consent of the parties capable of making the contract is necessary . in # , the california supreme court became the first state court in the country to strike down a law prohibiting interracial marriage . it was the only state supreme court to do so before the united states supreme court invalidated all those laws in # . the california supreme court held that "marriage is . something more than a civil contract subject to regulation by the state ; it is a fundamental right of free men . legislation infringing such rights must be based upon more than prejudice and must be free from oppressive discrimination to comply with the constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection of the laws" ( perez v . sharp ( # ) # cal . #d # , # ) . the california supreme court explained that "the right to marry is the right to join in marriage with the person of one 's choice" ( id . , at p . # ) . in # , the legislature amended the state 's marriage law to replace the gender - neutral description of marriage with language specifically limiting marriage to a "civil contract between a man and a woman . " the legislature 's express purpose for this amendment was to prohibit same - sex couples from marrying . the gender - specific description of marriage that the legislature adopted in # specifically discriminated in favor of heterosexual couples and discriminated against , and continues to discriminate against , same - sex couples . other jurisdictions have chosen to treat as valid or otherwise recognize marriages between same - sex couples . california 's discriminatory marriage law therefore also harms california 's same - sex couples when they travel to other jurisdictions by preventing them from having access to the rights , benefits , and protections those jurisdictions provide only to married couples . by excluding same - sex couples from marriage , california 's marriage law discriminates against members of same - sex couples based on their sexual orientation and based on their gender . the exclusion of same - sex couples from marriage is based in significant part on , and perpetuates , gender stereotypes about the roles of men and women in families and in society . california 's discriminatory exclusion of same - sex couples from marriage harms same - sex couples and their families by denying those couples and their families specific legal rights and responsibilities under state law and by depriving members of those couples and their families of a legal basis to challenge federal laws that deny access to the many important federal benefits and obligations provided only to spouses ( smelt v . county of orange ( #th cir . # ) # f . #d # , # ) . those federal benefits include the right to file joint federal income tax returns , the right to sponsor a partner for immigration to the united states , the right to social security survivor 's benefits , the right to family and medical leave , and many other substantial benefits and obligations . other jurisdictions have chosen to treat as valid or otherwise recognize marriages between same - sex couples . california 's discriminatory marriage law therefore also harms california 's same - sex couples when they travel to other jurisdictions by preventing them from having access to the rights , benefits , and protections those jurisdictions provide only to married couples . california 's discriminatory exclusion of same - sex couples from marriage further harms same - sex couples and their families by denying them the unique public recognition and validation that marriage confers . the legislature has an interest in encouraging stable relationships regardless of the gender or sexual orientation of the partners . the benefits that accrue to the general community when couples undertake the mutual obligations of marriage accrue regardless of the gender or sexual orientation of the partners . despite longstanding social and economic discrimination , many lesbian , gay , and bisexual californians have formed lasting , committed , and caring relationships with persons of the same sex . these couples share lives together and participate in their communities together , and many raise children and care for other dependent family members together . permitting same - sex couples to marry would further california 's interests in promoting family relationships and protecting family members during life crises . lesbian , gay , and bisexual californians have the same interests in marriage and in personal autonomy and privacy , including marrying the person of one 's choice , as heterosexual californians . despite the intentions of california 's domestic partnership statutes to reduce discrimination on the bases of sex and sexual orientation and to help california move closer to fulfilling the promises of inalienable rights , liberty , and equality contained in sections # and # of article i of the california constitution , relegating same - sex couples to the status of domestic partnership while prohibiting them from marrying causes severe and lasting harms to same - sex couples , their children , and their extended families ; stigmatizes same - sex couples , their children , their extended families and all gay , lesbian , and bisexual californians in violation of the california constitution ; violates california public policy by enabling and promoting discrimination by private actors and institutions on the basis of sexual orientation , contrary to california 's compelling interest in eradicating discrimination based on sexual orientation ; and puts same - sex couples and their families at risk of illegal discrimination by state and local government agencies and officials . it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this act to end the pernicious practice of marriage discrimination in california . california 's discriminatory exclusion of same - sex couples from marriage violates the california constitution 's guarantees of due process , privacy , equal protection of the law , and free expression by arbitrarily denying equal marriage rights to lesbian , gay , and bisexual californians . california 's exclusion of same - sex couples from marriage serves no legitimate government interest and is contrary to the public policies of california . the harms caused by prohibiting same - sex couples from marrying in california cannot be remedied , as required by the california constitution , by any measure short of permitting same - sex couples to marry in california . this act is in no way intended to alter section # . # of the family code , which prohibits california from treating as valid or otherwise recognizing marriages of same - sex couples solemnized outside of california . sec . # . section # of the family code is amended to read : # . marriage is a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between a man and a woman two persons , to which the consent of the parties capable of making that contract is necessary . consent alone does not constitute marriage . consent must be followed by the issuance of a license and solemnization as authorized by this division , except as provided by section # and part # ( commencing with section # ) . where necessary to implement the rights and responsibilities of spouses under the law , gender - specific terms shall be construed to be gender - neutral , except with respect to section # . # . for purposes of this part , the document issued by the county clerk is a marriage license until it is registered with the county recorder , at which time the license becomes a marriage certificate . sec . # . section # of the family code is amended to read : # . an two unmarried male persons of the age of # years or older , and an unmarried female of the age of # years or older , and who are not otherwise disqualified , are capable of consenting to and consummating marriage . sec . # . section # of the family code is amended to read : # . an unmarried male or female person under the age of # years is capable of consenting to and consummating marriage upon obtaining a court order granting permission to the underage person or persons to marry . the court order and written consent of the parents of each underage person , or of one of the parents or the guardian of each underage person shall be filed with the clerk of the court , and a certified copy of the order shall be presented to the county clerk at the time the marriage license is issued . sec . # . section # is added to the family code , to read : # . no priest , minister , or rabbi of any religious denomination , and no official of any nonprofit religious institution authorized to solemnize marriages , shall be required to solemnize any marriage in violation of his or her right to free exercise of religion guaranteed by the first amendment to the united states constitution or by section # of article i of the california constitution . sec . # . the legislature finds and declares that this act does not amend or modify section # . # of the family code , as enacted by an initiative measure , to the extent that section # . # addresses only marriages from other jurisdictions . sec . # . if the commission on state mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state , reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to part # ( commencing with section # ) of division # of title # of the government code .

existing law establishes the medi - cal program , administered by the state department of health care services , under which basic health care services are provided to qualified low - income persons . the medi - cal program is , in part , governed and funded by federal medicaid provisions . existing federal law requires states , beginning january # , # , as a condition of receiving federal medicaid funds , to provide health care services to persons who are under # years of age , not pregnant , not entitled to , or enrolled for , benefits under medicare part a , or enrolled for benefits under medicare part b , or as otherwise specified , and whose income does not exceed #% of the poverty line , as defined . this bill would require the department to establish , by january # , # , eligibility for medi - cal benefits for any person who meets these eligibility requirements . this bill would permit the department , to the extent permitted by federal law , to phase in coverage for those individuals . this bill would require the department to prepare and submit for approval to the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services an initial transition plan , as specified . this bill would also require the department to submit the initial transition plan to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature . because counties are required to make medi - cal eligibility determinations and this bill would expand medi - cal eligibility , the bill would impose a state - mandated local program . the california constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state . statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement . this bill would provide that , if the commission on state mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state , reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions . vote : majority . appropriation : no . fiscal committee : yes . state - mandated local program : yes . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . section # . # is added to the welfare and institutions code , to read : # . # . by january # , # , the department shall establish eligibility for medi - cal benefits for any person who meets the eligibility requirements of subclause of section # ( # ) and section # of title xix of the federal social security act ( # . sec . # et seq . ) . to the extent permitted by federal law , the department may phase in coverage for persons described in subdivision . the department shall , in accordance with the special terms and conditions for california 's bridge to reform section # medicaid demonstration ( #w - #/# ) , prepare and submit for approval to the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services an initial transition plan that contains all of the following : an outline of the process for determining eligibility for persons described in subdivision , including the transition of enrollees in the demonstration project pursuant to part # . # ( commencing with section # ) that does not require the enrollees to submit a new application . a plan to manage the transition to new eligibility levels in # by considering , reviewing , and preliminarily determining new applications beginning as early as july # , # . criteria for provider participation and the means of securing provider agreements for the transition . the schedule of implementation activities for the state to make the transition plan operational . the process the state will use to ensure adequate primary care and specialty provider networks . the department shall also submit the initial transition plan to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature . nothing in this section shall be construed to limit eligibility for medi - cal benefits as authorized by any other provision of law . sec . # . if the commission on state mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state , reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to part # ( commencing with section # ) of division # of title # of the government code . 
earned income . the personal income tax law authorizes various credits against the taxes imposed by that law . the federal internal revenue code authorizes a refundable earned income tax credit for certain low - income individuals who have earned income and who meet certain other requirements . this bill would state the intent of the legislature to enact legislation that would create an refundable earned income tax credit for low - income individuals working in california . the bill would also make findings and declarations in this regard . vote : majority . appropriation : no . fiscal committee : no . state - mandated local program : no . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . the legislature finds and declares all of the following : in its supplemental poverty measure report for the year # , released in october # , the united states census bureau reported california 's rate of poverty to be # . # percent . this rate is the highest among all # states . using census data released in september # , the california budget project ( cbp ) reported that the economic recovery from the great recession has largely bypassed low - and middle - income californians , with the bottom three - fifths of the income distribution experiencing stagnating income gains . this is contrasted with the top one - fifth of the income distribution experiencing gains of # . # percent . a briefing on poverty released by the cbp in august # reports that # percent of families living in poverty were supported by one or more workers in # . given that the majority of families living in poverty are working families in california , it is evident that poverty largely reflects low - paying jobs , not the absence of employment . in california , the public policy institute of california ( ppic ) , in collaboration with the stanford center on poverty and inequality , has developed the california poverty measure ( cpm ) , which underscores the role of california 's social safety net , amount which includes the calfresh program , calworks , and the federal earned income tax credit ( eitc ) , in mitigating poverty . using data from # , a ppic report on the cpm released in october # , reveals that # percent of californians , # . # million people , lived in poverty . a comparison of cpm rates by county show that the three most populous counties , los angeles county , san diego county , and orange county , all had rates above the statewide cpm at # . # percent , # . # percent , and # . # percent , respectively . the cpm rate for children statewide for children , those under the age of # , was # . # percent , the highest rate of any age group . this amounts to # . # million of california 's children living in poverty . without need - based safety net programs and resources , over # percent of californians would be living in poverty . the absence of the safety net would increase the poverty rate among california 's children to # percent according to the cpm . refundable tax credits , including the federal eitc , reduced the poverty rate in california by # . # percent overall . among children , the poverty rate reduction was # percent . this means that # , # fewer children and # , # fewer working - age adults , # . # million people fewer in total , are living in poverty when refundable tax credits are accounted for in the cpm . according to the national conference of state legislatures , # states in the country and the district of columbia , provide an eitc in addition to the federal eitc . california does not currently have a state eitc . ( # ) a brookings institution report issued in january # , shows that in addition to boosting the family incomes of families in poverty , state eitc refunds served as an important economic stimulus for the communities and regions of the families by magnifying the impact of the federal eitc overall . based on these findings and declarations , it is the intent of the legislature to enact legislation that would create an refundable earned income tax credit for low - income individuals working in california . 
existing law provides that a digital signature , as defined , may be used in a written communication with a public agency with the same force and effect as the use of a manual signature if specified requirements are met . this bill would require the secretary of state to design , develop , and implement a digital electoral system for the collection , storage , and processing of electronically generated and transmitted digital messages to permit any eligible person to register to vote , sign any petition , and vote in any election using the digital system . a willful manipulation of the digital electoral system would be a crime , thus imposing a state - mandated local program . the bill would require the secretary of state and all county elections officials to permit the use of digital signatures for voter registration , voting , and signing of petitions . this additional requirement on county elections officials would impose a state - mandated local program . the california constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state . statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement , including the creation of a state mandates claims fund to pay the costs of mandates that do not exceed $# , #

ordered services were provided has met or exceeded the time period set forth in paragraph , , or of subdivision of section # . # , as appropriate , and a child is not returned to the custody of a parent or legal guardian at the permanency hearing held pursuant to subdivision , the court shall do one of the following : continue the case for up to six months for a permanency review hearing , provided that the hearing shall occur within # months of the date the child was originally taken from the physical custody of his or her parent or legal guardian . the court shall continue the case only if it finds that there is a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or legal guardian and safely maintained in the home within the extended period of time or that reasonable services have not been provided to the parent or legal guardian . for the purposes of this section , in order to find a substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or legal guardian and safely maintained in the home within the extended period of time , the court shall be required to find all of the following : that the parent or legal guardian has consistently and regularly contacted and visited with the child . that the parent or legal guardian has made significant progress in resolving problems that led to the child 's removal from the home . the parent or legal guardian has demonstrated the capacity and ability both to complete the objectives of his or her treatment plan and to provide for the child 's safety , protection , physical and emotional well - being , and special needs . for purposes of this subdivision , the court 's decision to continue the case based on a finding or substantial probability that the child will be returned to the physical custody of his or her parent or legal guardian is a compelling reason for determining that a hearing held pursuant to section # . # is not in the best interests of the child . the court shall inform the parent or legal guardian that if the child cannot be returned home by the next permanency review hearing , a proceeding pursuant to section # . # may be instituted . the court shall not order that a hearing pursuant to section # . # be held unless there is clear and convincing evidence that reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parent or legal guardian . order that a hearing be held within # days , pursuant to section # . # , but only if the court does not continue the case to the permanency planning review hearing and there is clear and convincing evidence that reasonable services have been provided or offered to the parents or legal guardians . order that the child remain in long -

 under existing law , the public utilities commission is vested with regulatory authority over public utilities , including electrical corporations , and authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility . existing law authorizes the commission to approve an increase of one - half of # percent to # percent in the rate of return otherwise allowed an electrical corporation for investment by the corporation in generation facilities using renewable resources . this bill would authorize the commission , after a hearing , to approve a similar increase in the rate of return for investment by a corporation in energy storage facilities , as defined , that meet any of specified requirements . the bill would require the commission to develop a time - variant tariff that establishes and maximizes incentives for the storage and dispatch of energy by an eligible facility . the bill would require the commission , in consultation with the energy commission , to prepare and submit a report to the governor and the legislature , by january # , # , on the costs and benefits to ratepayers of energy storage . the bill would require an electrical corporation to develop a standard contract or tariff providing for energy storage metering that accounts separately for both the charging and discharging of energy by an energy storage system , and to make this contract available to eligible facilities upon request . under existing law , a violation of the public utilities act or an order or direction of the commission is a crime . because the provisions of this bill would require an order or other action of the commission to implement , and a violation of that order or action would be a crime , the bill would impose a state - mandated local program by creating a new crime . the california constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state . statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement . this bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason . vote : majority . appropriation : no . fiscal committee : yes . state - mandated local program : yes . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . section # . # is added to the public utilities code , to read : # . # . the commission , after a hearing , may approve an increase of one - half of # percent to # percent in the rate of return otherwise allowed an electrical corporation for investment by the corporation in energy storage facilities that meet any of the following requirements : the facility stores energy generated from an eligible renewable energy resource , as defined in section # . # , during off - peak periods , as defined by the commission , and dispatches the energy during on - peak periods , as defined by the commission . the facility is capable of responding to independent system operator commands to either absorb or dispatch energy from the grid and is capable of storing the energy for a minimum of two hours . the facility is capable of providing frequency and area control error regulation required to integrate intermittent renewable resources and maintain reliable operation of the electrical grid . sec . # . chapter # . # ( commencing with section # ) is added to part # of division # of the public utilities code , to read : chapter # . # . energy storage systems # . this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the integration of renewable energy act . # . # . for the purposes of this chapter the following terms have the following meanings : "energy storage system" means any technology that is capable of absorbing energy from a generation facility , storing it for a period of time , and dispatching the energy onto the grid . energy storage systems include , but are not limited to , hydrogen storage , pumped hydroelectricity storage , compressed air energy storage , superconducting magnetic energy storage , flow batteries , cell batteries , super capacitors , and fly wheels . "eligible storage facility" or "eligible facility" means any facility that employs an energy storage technology that meets at least one of the following requirements : the facility stores energy generated from an eligible renewable energy resource , as defined in section # . # , during off - peak periods and dispatches the energy during on - peak periods . the facility is capable of responding to independent system operator commands to either absorb or dispatch energy from the grid and is capable of storing the energy for a minimum of two hours . the facility provides frequency and area control error regulation required to integrate intermittent renewable resources and maintain reliable operation of the electrical grid . # . # . the legislature finds and declares all of the following : energy storage systems can potentially enable higher percentages of renewable energy to be included in california 's power supply portfolio by transforming intermittent generation , such as wind and solar power , into dispatchable resources , allowing the state to more fully utilize its abundant renewable resources . energy storage systems can serve as load shifting technologies by absorbing energy during off - peak periods , such as from wind resources at night , and delivering the energy when demand is greatest , thereby potentially reducing the need for , and associated greenhouse gas emissions from , gas - fired peaker plants . energy storage systems can greatly enhance the flexibility of the operation of the power grid by quickly absorbing or dispatching energy when needed . energy storage systems that have an inverter can deliver reactive power as well as real power . this is particularly useful when the storage systems are located in load centers as they can help support the voltage in a transmission - constrained area . it is the intent of the legislature to facilitate the expansion and deployment of energy storage systems , which are critical to the timely and cost - effective achievement of the state 's ambitious renewables portfolio standard , greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets , and regional air quality objectives while maintaining reliable operation of the power grid . # . # . the commission shall develop a time - variant tariff that establishes and maximizes incentives for an eligible storage facility to do both of the following : store energy when demand is low or to ensure reliable operation of the electrical grid . dispatch stored energy during peak demand or to ensure reliable operation of the electrical grid while intermittent resources are ramping up or down . by january # , # , the commission , in consultation with the energy commission , shall prepare and submit a report to the governor and the legislature on the costs and benefits to ratepayers of energy storage . # . # . every electrical corporation shall develop a standard contract or tariff providing for energy storage metering that accounts separately for both the charging and discharging of energy by an energy storage system , and shall make this contract available to eligible facilities upon request . an electrical corporation shall make all necessary forms and contracts for energy storage metering service available for download from the internet . sec . # . no reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to section # of article xiii b of the california constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction , eliminates a crime or infraction , or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction , within the meaning of section # of the government code , or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of section # of article xiii b of the california constitution .

existing law authorizes public agencies to operate curbside household hazardous waste collection facilities , door - to - door household hazardous waste collection programs , and household hazardous waste residential pickup services , and specifies conditions for the transportation of household hazardous waste . this bill would express the legislature 's intent to enact legislation that would establish curbside household hazardous waste collection programs , door - to - door household hazardous waste collection programs , and household hazardous waste residential pickup services as the principal means of collecting household hazardous waste and diverting it from california 's landfills and waterways . vote : majority . appropriation : no . fiscal committee : no . state - mandated local program : no . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . the legislature finds and declares all of the following : household hazardous waste is creating environmental , health , and workplace safety issues . whether due to unused pharmaceuticals , batteries , medical devices , or other disposable consumer items , effective and efficient disposal remains an extraordinary challenge . state and local efforts to address disposal of these items have been well intended , but ultimately these piecemeal and truncated approaches have not proved effective . these approaches fragment the collection of household hazardous waste and move collection away from the closest and most practical point of disposal : the consumer 's residence . a number of cities in california are already using curbside household hazardous waste collection programs , door - to - door household hazardous waste collection programs , and household hazardous waste residential pickup services as mechanisms for collecting and disposing of many commonly used household items for which disposal has been the subject of state legislation or local ordinances . the waste disposal companies and local governments that have implemented these programs and services have found them to be successful and inexpensive . it is the intent of the legislature to enact legislation that would establish curbside household hazardous waste collection programs , door - to - door household hazardous waste collection programs , and household hazardous waste residential pickup services as the principal means of collecting household hazardous waste and diverting it from california 's landfills and waterways . 
charges and surcharges . existing law , the song - beverly credit card act of # , provides an extensive scheme for the regulation of credit card transactions in this state . this bill would prohibit a card issuer from imposing any charge upon a cardholder for timely or full payment of credit card debt , as specified . existing law , commencing july # , # , provides that no operator of an atm in this state shall impose any surcharge upon a customer for the usage of that machine whether or not the customer is using an access device issued by that operator unless the surcharge is clearly disclosed to the customer electronically on the atm , and , unless the disclosure is made prior to the customer being obligated to pay the surcharge , the customer shall be provided an opportunity to cancel the transaction without incurring any surcharge , with specified exceptions . existing law , operative july # , # , also provides for total price and fee disclosure with respect to the sale of goods and services conducted at an atm , as specified . this bill would , instead , prohibit the operator of an automated teller machine ( atm ) from imposing a surcharge upon atm usage whether or not the customer is using an access device issued by that operator . the bill would , however , allow a surcharge , as specified , with respect to the sale of goods or services conducted at the atm . the bill would also prohibit the imposition of any surcharge for telephone teller inquiries if no more than # telephone inquiries are made per month . the bill would also state legislative intent . vote : majority . appropriation : no . fiscal committee : no . state - mandated local program : no . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . the legislature finds and declares as follows : according to a study conducted by the united states public interest research group ( uspirg ) , from # to # , the rate of bank fees nationwide increased at rates at least double the rate of inflation , as measured by the consumer price index . the uspirg study also found , from # to # , the average annual cost for a consumer to maintain a regular , noninterest - bearing checking account rose # percent . average monthly maintenance fees for regular checking accounts were up # percent . for many people the burden of escalating bank fees can be a true hardship . therefore , they are forced to utilize expensive check cashing services and bill paying alternatives , such as money orders . elderly individuals dependent upon fixed incomes cannot afford the risks of investing in stock or bond markets and require bank accounts insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation . many young people beginning their careers may not be able to afford the high cost of maintaining a checking account . many california consumers are also paying increasing fees for telephone inquiries , atm services , cyber inquiries , and monthly services . this is bothersome and a burden to california consumers because the fees in some cases are very high . additionally , in many cases , financial institutions are recovering atm costs from other financial institutions . of greatest concern is that financial institutions are earning interest on deposited moneys and are charging per - transaction fees for consumers to have access to their own money . therefore , it is the intent of the legislature that section # of the act enacting this section apply to all financial institutions having a contractual relationship for checking account services with consumers residing in california . the legislature also finds that financial institutions may effectively recover all their costs through monthly fees charged to account holders . charging special fees for various services of the financial institution results in increased costs to consumers with no increased benefit . in low - income cases , consumers may not have the luxury of shopping around for the financial institution with the lowest fees . typically , accounts having the lowest fees have highest deposit requirements . financial institutions are encouraging the use of atms by charging for human teller services , electronic telephone inquiries , and other services . financial institutions have led consumers and the legislature to believe that atm usage is better for both consumers and financial institutions because atm usage keeps costs down for the financial institution . many consumers , especially low - income , seniors , aid recipients , disabled , and those with language barriers , have a difficult time using atms . fees intended to encourage these people to use atms may place these people at risk and increase governmental costs associated with enforcement of crime laws by causing these people to carry greater amounts of cash or to use atms that are not safe . the legislature in enacting section # of the act enacting this section additionally finds that some consumers are paying charges for timely or full payment of credit card debt . the legislature finds that these charges serve as a disincentive for prudent personal fiscal management necessary for americans to pay off the $# billion credit card debt that is currently owed . in march # , credit card debt hit a #year high with more than $# . # billion being delinquent . sec . # . section # . # is added to the civil code , to read : # . # . a card issuer may not impose any charge upon a cardholder for timely or full payment of credit card debt including a charge for the payment of a credit card balance in full , or a charge for the carrying of no monthly balance . as used in this section , the term "charge" includes any service charge or other charge that negatively affects the amount a cardholder is to receive under a cash back program or the existence of , or the amount of , any annual fee imposed by a card issuer for usage of a credit card . sec . # . section # of the financial code , as amended by chapter # of the statutes of # , is amended to read : # . no except as provided in subdivision , an operator of an automated teller machine ( atm ) in this state shall may not impose any surcharge upon a customer for the usage of that machine whether or not the customer is using an access device issued by that operator unless that surcharge is clearly disclosed to the customer electronically on the automated teller machine . unless the disclosure is made prior to the customer being obligated to pay the surcharge , the customer shall be provided an opportunity to cancel that transaction without incurring any surcharge . this subdivision does not apply to a point of sale transaction at an atm . if the sale of a good or service is conducted at the atm , the operator of that atm shall disclose to the customer electronically on the atm the total price of the good or service and , pursuant to subdivision , any fee charged surcharge imposed solely for the usage of the atm . unless the disclosure is made prior to the customer being obligated to pay for the good or service , the customer shall be provided with an opportunity to cancel the transaction without incurring any obligation . if a surcharge is imposed on a customer using uses an access device not issued by the operator , the operator shall disclose that the customer may also be charged an additional a fee by his or her own institution . an operator may not impose any surcharge for telephone teller inquiries if no more than six telephone teller inquiries are made per month . as used in this section , "operator , " "automated teller machine , " "customer , " and "access device" have the meanings set forth in section # . the term "surcharge" means any charge imposed by the operator of the atm solely for use of the atm . the term "service" includes , but is not limited to , receiving a statement of account activity . the term "telephone teller inquiry" means customer usage of a touch tone telephone and a personal identification number ( pin ) for the purpose of securing account information .

diminishing resources , the coordination of services is not simply a desired goal ; it is an absolute imperative . the geographic diversity of the state of california and targeted counties ( los angeles county , fresno county , san bernardino county , sacramento county , and the city and county of san francisco ) creates a complex backdrop for the provision of integrated community services . with such a huge geography covered in the state and a blend of urban and rural communities , there is an uneven distribution of service capacity and service capabilities across the state . localized needs assessments , community organizing and infrastructure development , as well as a better coordination and a system of linkage and referral will aid in ensuring access to and utilization of comprehensive service networks that include an alcohol and drug treatment agency , a mental health agency , a social services agency , and a primary health care provider . uninsured and indigent populations in california rely on the county 's institutions , systems , and individual health professionals that provide a significant volume of alcohol and drug programs and health care services without regard for ability to pay . in many counties in the state , these community - based providers are struggling to care for the increasing numbers of uninsured and indigent individuals . they face many challenges such as an uneven distribution of the burden of uncompensated care and treatment , the fragmentation of services for the poor and indigent , insufficient numbers of certain types of providers , reduced medi - cal revenues due to the pressures of medi - cal managed care , and a growing need for mental health and substance abuse services . the uninsureds also rely heavily on expensive emergency rooms , and because they lack a routine source of care , they often do not receive needed followup or specialty services . while integration among these providers is critical to serve the uninsured and indigent with greater efficiency and effectiveness and to improve quality of care , many of these community - based providers are so pressured by basic caregiving tasks , they need assistance to coordinate their efforts with other providers and to develop integrated community - based systems of care . sec . # . part # . # ( commencing with section # . # ) is added to division # . # of the health and safety code , to read : part # . # . community network service provider demonstration project # . # . the department shall establish a three -

however , this guidance is unlikely to significantly reduce the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in livestock because of a broad exemption allowing for the use of antibiotics for disease prevention . not only do antibiotic - resistant bacteria affect the health of our society , but they also have a monetary impact . in # , the national academy of sciences noted that antibiotic - resistant bacteria generate a minimum of four to five billion dollars in costs to united states society and individuals every year . in # , in a study funded by the federal centers for disease control and prevention , cook county hospital and alliance for prudent use of antibiotics estimated that the total health care cost of antibiotic - resistant infections in the united states was between $# . # billion and $# billion annually . societal costs from lost productivity due to illnesses were estimated to be an additional $# billion . in april # , the united states government accountability office conducted a study concluding that three strains of microorganisms that cause foodborne illnesses or disease in humans are resistant to antibiotics and are linked to the use of antibiotics in animals . these microorganisms that cause foodborne illnesses or disease in humans are resistant to antibiotics and are linked to the use of antibiotics in animals . these microorganisms are salmonella , campylobacter , and e . coli . in # , # , and # , the united states department of agriculture 's animal and plant health inspection service conducted large - scale , voluntary surveys that revealed all of the following : eighty - four percent of grower and finisher swine farms , # percent of cattle feedlots , and # percent of sheep farms administer antimicrobials in feed or water for either health or growth promotion reasons . many of the antimicrobials that were identified were identical or closely related to drugs used in human medicine , including tetracyclines , macrolides , bactricin , penicilllins , and sulfonamides . these drugs are used in people to treat serious diseases , such as pneumonia , scarlet fever , rheumatic fever , sexually transmitted infections , and skin infections ; pandemics such as malaria and plague ; and bioterrorism agents such as anthrax . in june # , the peer - reviewed journal , "clinical infectious diseases , " published a report based on a two - year review , by experts in human and veterinary medicine , public health , microbiology , biostatistics , and risk analysis , of more than # scientific studies on the human health impacts of antimicrobial use in agriculture . the report recommended that antimicrobial agents should not be used in agriculture in the absence of disease and should be limited to therapy for diseased individual animals or prophylaxis when disease is documented in a herd or flock . in a march # report , the national academy of sciences stated that a decrease in antimicrobial use in human medicine alone will have little effect on the rise in antibiotic - resistant bacteria and that substantial efforts must be made to decrease the inappropriate overuse of antimicrobials in animals and agriculture . in # , the peer - reviewed journal , "molecular cell , " published a study demonstrating that a low - dosage use of antibiotics causes a dramatic increase in genetic mutation , raising new concerns about the agricultural practice of using low - dosage antibiotics in order to stimulate growth promotion and routinely prevent disease in unhealthy conditions . in # , the danish veterinary and food administration testified that the danish ban of the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in food animal production resulted in a marked reduction in antimicrobial resistance in multiple bacterial species , including campylobacter and enterococci . in # , the fda found that in # : thirteen million five hundred thousand kilograms of antibacterial drugs were sold for use on food animals in the united states . three million three hundred thousand kilograms of antibacterial drugs were used for human health . eighty percent of antibacterial drugs , and over # percent of medically important antibacterial drugs , disseminated in the united states were sold for use on food - producing animals , rather than being used for human health . in # , a review of all scientific studies on antimicrobial use in farm animals , published in clinical microbiology reviews , found the following : that the use of antibiotics in food - producing animals leads to the development of reservoirs of antibiotic resistance , that antibiotic - resistant bacteria can spread through food , water , air , soil , and meat - industry workers , and that bacteria can share resistance genes with each other . a ban on nontherapeutic antibiotic use in food - producing animals would preserve the use of antibiotics for medicine . a danish ban on nontherapeutic antibiotics in food - producing animals resulted in little change in animal morbidity and mortality , and only a modest increase in production cost . the federal centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) concluded in a recent report , "antibiotic resistance threats in the united states , # , " that overuse or misuse of antibiotics contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance , whether in human medicine or in agriculture . the cdc estimated that antibiotic resistance causes at least # , # deaths and two million illnesses every year . in # , the peer - reviewed journal , "the journal of the american medical association , " published a study showing higher levels of antibiotic - resistant skin and soft - tissue infections in people living in proximity to hog farms or fields treated with swine manure in pennsylvania . similarly , in # , the peer - reviewed journal , "infection control and hospital epidemiology , " published a study focused on hospitalized veterans in rural areas of iowa , finding that people living in close proximity to a swine - feeding operation were nearly three times as likely to have been affected by methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) at the time of admission to the hospital . the fda 's national antimicrobial resistance monitoring system routinely finds that retail meat products are contaminated with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics that are important to human medicine . according to the american academy of pediatrics , "the largest nonhuman use of antimicrobial agents is in food - producing animal production , and most of this is in healthy animals to increase growth or prevent diseases . evidence now exists that these uses of antimicrobial agents in food - producing animals have a direct negative impact on human health and multiple impacts on the selection and dissemination of resistance genes in animals and the environment . children are at increased risk of acquiring many of these infections with resistant bacteria and are at great risk of severe complications if they become infected . " many scientific studies confirm that the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in food - producing animals contributes to the development of antibiotic - resistant bacterial infections in people . the spread of antibiotic - resistant bacteria poses a risk to the health of californians and reduced use of antibiotics for livestock production is likely to reduce the risks of the rise and spread of antibiotic - resistant bacteria through food and other pathways , thus reducing the risk to californians . sec . # . it is the intent of the legislature to enact legislation that would address the overuse of antibiotics in livestock production . 
immigration policy enforcement . existing federal law authorizes any authorized immigration officer to issue an immigration detainer that serves to advise another law enforcement agency that the federal department seeks custody of an alien presently in the custody of that agency , for the purpose of arresting and removing the alien . existing federal law provides that the detainer is a request that the agency advise the department , prior to release of the alien , in order for the department to arrange to assume custody in situations when gaining immediate physical custody is either impracticable or impossible . this bill would prohibit a law enforcement official , as defined , from detaining an individual on the basis of a united states immigration and customs enforcement hold after that individual becomes eligible for release from criminal custody , unless , at the time that the individual becomes eligible for release from criminal custody , certain conditions are met . vote : majority . appropriation : no . fiscal committee : no . state - mandated local program : no . the people of the state of california do enact as follows : section # . the legislature finds and declares all of the following : the united states immigration and customs enforcement 's ( ice ) secure communities program shifts the burden of federal civil immigration enforcement onto local law enforcement . to operate the secure communities program , ice relies on voluntary requests , known as ice holds or detainers , to local law enforcement to hold individuals in local jails for additional time beyond when they would be eligible for release in a criminal matter . state and local law enforcement agencies are not reimbursed by the federal government for the full cost of responding to a detainer , which can include , but is not limited to , extended detention time and the administrative costs of tracking and responding to detainers . unlike criminal detainers , which are supported by a warrant and require probable cause , there is no requirement for a warrant and no established standard of proof , such as reasonable suspicion or probable cause , for issuing an ice detainer request . immigration detainers have erroneously been placed on united states citizens as well as immigrants who are not deportable . the secure communities program and immigration detainers harm community policing efforts because immigrant residents who are victims of or witnesses to crime , including domestic violence , are less likely to report crime or cooperate with law enforcement when any contact with law enforcement could result in deportation . the program can result in a person being held and transferred into immigration detention without regard to whether the arrest is the result of a mistake , or merely a routine practice of questioning individuals involved in a dispute without pressing charges . victims or witnesses to crimes may otherwise have recourse to lawful status ( such as u - visas or t - visas ) that detention resulting from the secure communities program obstructs . it is the intent of the legislature that this act shall not be construed as providing , expanding , or ratifying the legal authority for any state or local law enforcement agency to detain an individual on an immigration hold . sec . # . chapter # . # ( commencing with section # ) is added to division # of title # of the government code , to read : chapter # . # . standards for responding to united states immigration and customs enforcement holds # . for purposes of this chapter , the following terms have the following meanings : "conviction" shall have the same meaning as subdivision of section # of the penal code . "eligible for release from criminal custody" means that the individual may be released from criminal custody because one of the following conditions has occurred : all criminal charges against the individual have been dropped or dismissed . the individual has been acquitted of all criminal charges filed against him or her . the individual has served all the time required for his or her sentence . the individual has posted a bond . the individual is otherwise eligible for release under state or local law , or local policy .

related audit items is the highest compliance level of any facility within the division of juvenile facilities . closure of the preston youth correctional facility will also require the termination of the ward incentive program , which is a major component in farrell v . cate compliance . terminating this program will push the state backwards rather than forward with farrell v . cate compliance . the preston youth correctional facility is the only facility to provide an open environment for rehabilitation and offers programs that other facilities do not provide . the james a . wieden high school at the preston youth correctional facility has a #percent graduation rate , which is higher than the graduation rate at any other division facility . officials from the division have testified that the closure of the preston youth correctional facility will not provide any immediate cost savings . in addition to losing a successful youth correctional facility , the economic impact on the city of ione and to the county of amador will be significant . the county has already suffered numerous large business closures . with the department being the largest employer in the county , the closure of the preston youth correctional facility will be devastating . in light of the transfer of many juveniles to county custody , the legislature is mindful that there is a need for the department of corrections and rehabilitation , division of juvenile facilities to downsize in order to meet the needs of a smaller population and budget constraints . accordingly , it is the intent of the legislature to shed light on the decisions being made within the department and the division to ensure an orderly downsizing of the remaining facilities and to provide information on how to best serve a dwindling juvenile offender population . it is the intent of the legislature to put an immediate halt to the closing of any youth correctional facility , including the preston youth correctional facility in the city of ione , by the department or the division until the process and procedures that the department and division are using for downsizing the remaining facilities have been made clear and have been scrutinized . if the preston youth correctional facility or any other facility is slated for closure , it shall be after a transparent and open process that addresses the economic impact of the closure . each facility shall be analyzed for closure , and the analysis shall identify the benefits and risks to the wards , the public , and the local community . sec . # . the department of corrections and rehabilitation , division of juvenile facilities shall not close any youth correctional facility during the six - month period following the effective date of this act . it is expected that during the period specified in subdivision , ongoing activity levels at each division facility shall equal the activity levels that were in place immediately prior to october # , # , when the department announced its plans to close the preston youth correctional facility , and that the number of wardens , teachers , officers , administrators , support staff , and other employees needed to run the facilities and programs shall likewise be maintained at those levels during that period . wards shall not be transferred from a facility for the purpose of decreasing population levels at that facility . sec . # . this act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace , health , or safety within the meaning of article iv of the constitution and shall go into immediate effect . the facts constituting the necessity are : the department of corrections and rehabilitation has announced plans to close the preston youth correctional facility in the city of ione . closure of this facility will impact the state 's farrell v . cate compliance and will be devastating to the economy of amador county . time is needed to address the economic impact of the closure and to identify what factors were considered by the department in reaching its decision .
